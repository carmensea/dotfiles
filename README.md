navigating my jawn:  

i = insert mode  
o = insert on new line  
p = paste on new line  
ciw = cut inner word (puts you in INSERT mode)  
ct * = cut to WHATEVER CHAR U WANT. (ex: ct" will cut everything out until you get to quote. very nifty)  
ctr t = yank (copy)  
ctr v = visual block (ycan highlight by characters (up, down, left/right))  
shift v = highlights an entire line (use this in conjuction with yank or delete)  
ctrl n = open and close nerd tree  
;q = quit  
;w = write  
;wq = write quit  
;q! = force quit  
;wq! = force write quite  
;vs [file] = vertical split (put a space and you can tab into a new file)  
;e [file] = change into new file  
ctr f | = adds another pane vertically. good for debugging, irb, running ruby.   
ctrl l = moves from your pane to the right pane  
ctrl h = moves from your pane to the left pane  
ctrl j = moves from your pane down  
ctr k = moves from your pane up  
j = moves down  
k = moves up  
l = moves right  
h = moves left  
shift a = moves cursor to end of line in INSERT mode  
shift i = moves cursor to beginning of line in INSERT mode  
w = moves cursor forward one whole word  
b = moves cursor backward one whole word  
u = undo   
ctr r = redo   
shift d = deletes from cursor to the end of line  
dd = deletes an entire line  
ctrl u = page up  
ctr d = page down  
gg = goes to the top of file  
shift g = goes to the bottom of file  
. = repeats whatever you just did. helps with tedious tasks
